# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->   

####This study deals with questions about possible relationships between gun ownership and race, sex, political views, opinions on capitol punishment and belief in god. The data is from the 2014 general social survey.



# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

#Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

# Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->


# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variables causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->

After looking at the graphical, numerical and inferential results, we can conclude:
-Belief in God and gun ownership are independant of each other. This means that there is no relationship between the variables.

-Race and gun ownership are related. The white group and other group are more likely to own guns than the black group.

-Sex and gun ownership are related. Males are more likely to own guns than females.

-Opinion on capital punishment and gun ownership are related. People that favor capital punishment are more likley to own guns than people who oppose capital punishment.

-Political views and gun ownership are related. Conservatives are more likely to own guns than the liberals and moderates.

In conclusion, if there was a profile made on people who own guns. They are most likely going to be a conservative, who favors capital punishment, is male and either white or other. If there was a profile made on people who donâ€™t guns, they are most likely to be female, oppose capital punishment, be liberal or moderate and black.

A variable that could affect the results are whether people from this sample grew up around guns or have ever encountered a gun in their life.
